#Arithmetic operators
# x=15
# y=4
#
# print(x+y)
# print(x-y)
# print(x*y)
# print(x/y)
# print(x%y) #remainder
# print(x**y) #ex potential
# print(x//y) #floor division, round the result to nearest full number


# #Assignment operators
# x = 10 # "=" is assigning operator
# x += 2
# print(x) #adding
# x -= 4
# print(x) #substract
# x *= 4
# print(x)
# x /= 4
# print(x)
# x **= 4
# print(x)



#Comparison operators
# x = 10  #values are equal or bigger or smaller
# y = 6
#
# print(x == y)
# print(x != y)
# print(x > y )
# print(x < y )
# print(x >= y )
# print(x <= y )

#Logical operators
#x=10
#y=4

#print(x==y and x>y)
#print(x==y or x>y)


#Identity operators (two objects are compared, shows true or false)
# x = ["Umar", "Faruque"]
# y = ["Umar", "Faruque"]

# print(x is y) #false
# print(x == y) #true
# print(x is not y) #true


#Membership operators (are in or not in)
# x = ["Umar", "Faruque"]
# y = ["Umar", "Faruque"]
#
# print("Faruque" in y)
# print("Faruque" not in y)


#Bitwise operators (Mostly works in Binary numbers)
#bitwise operators are "&"AND, "|"OR, "~"NOT, "^"XOR
# 0 - 00
# 1 - 01
# 2 - 10
# 3 - 11
#
# x = 10
# y = 11
# print(x & y)
# print(x | y)
